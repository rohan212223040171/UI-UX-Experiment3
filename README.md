## Aim:
To apply Heuristic Evaluation of an Existing Website or App

## Algorithm:
The Amazon.in website is designed as a large online marketplace, so it presents a high-density layout with many product categories displayed simultaneously. Its homepage contains multiple sections such as home décor, appliances, electronics, and automotive essentials, each shown through small product tiles and offer banners. This makes the interface visually busy and encourages users to browse different items. The navigation bar is packed with options like account, returns, cart, and a wide range of category links, showing that Amazon focuses on giving users access to thousands of products in one place. The color scheme is more muted and professional, and the hero banner features books and a shopper, creating a lifestyle-oriented feel. On the other hand, Swiggy’s website is far simpler and more goal-oriented because it focuses mainly on food and grocery delivery. It uses a bright orange background, large fonts, and spacious layout to attract attention instantly. The homepage directly asks users to enter their location and search for restaurants, making ordering the primary action. Only a few large cards are shown, representing food delivery, Instamart, and dining out, which reduces distractions and guides users quickly into the ordering flow. Swiggy’s design is colorful, energetic, and minimal, while Amazon’s design is dense, functional, and variety-driven. Overall, Amazon aims to promote broad product exploration, whereas Swiggy focuses on speed, simplicity, and converting the user quickly into a food order.
